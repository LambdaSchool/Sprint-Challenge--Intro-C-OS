## Challenge 1

Name at least three things that an operating system is responsible for handling?

*  Operating systems are responsible for running all processes of the computer.

*  As an extension to the above, operating systems are also responsible for handling the task of supplying processes access to unique memory. Upon execution of any application, the OS allocates a new, free piece of memory for a stack frame. This is known as the address space of the process.

*  Operating systems are also responsible for the file system of the computer, dictating the layout of it's architecture, and keeping a record of this system in the file table.

*  Operating systems are also responsible for scheduling. Scheduling at it's simplest, in the modern computer era, is the management of it's processes wherein all currently running applications are allocated time to a core as seen fit by the OS, as the computer is limited to running as many programs as there are cores to the computer.
