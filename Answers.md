1. Responsibilites of the OS are:
    * it hides the complexity of a given hardware form the user.
    * it handles the gnereated *_interrupts_* by I/O controllers.
    * it handles the sharing of I/O between different programs using the CPU.
    * it manages hardware's resources such as processors, memory, data storage and I/O devices.
The above listed responsibilites can generally described as follows:

* **Managing hardware and software resources**: is an essential task of an OS to handle the competition of various programs and input methods to get attention form CPU and demand memory, storage and I/O bandwidth as per their demand. Thus, here an OS plays a major role of handling by making sure that each appplication gets the necessary resources while playing nicely with all the other applications.
* **Providing a consistent application interface**: is very important and applicable when there is a need to be more than one of a particular type of computer using the OS. Thus, a developer can write an appilication on one computer and have a high level of confidence that it will run on another computer of the same type since the OS is prroviding a consistent application program interface (API).
