Three things that an operating system is responsible for handling:

1) PROCESSES - The OS reads and executes many different programs in parallel, switching rapidly between them to save memory.

2) MEMORY - To keep track of each program’s state, the OS allocates an "address space" in the machine’s RAM.

3) FILE SYSTEM - The OS is like a librarian to the machine's vast library of files.
