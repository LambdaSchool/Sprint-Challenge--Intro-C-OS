#### Basic functions of OS: 
* Loading applications into RAM and executing them;
* It provides access to peripheral devices (input-output devices);
* Management of RAM (distribution between processes, virtual memory);
* Controlling access to data on non-volatile media (such as Hard Disk, CD, etc.), usually using a file system;
* User interface;
* Network operations, protocol stack support;

#### Additional functions:
* Parallel or pseudo-parallel execution of tasks (multitasking);
* Interaction between processes: data exchange, mutual synchronization;
* Protect the system itself, as well as user data and programs from malicious user or application actions;
* Differentiation of access rights and multi-user mode of operation

#### P.S. I need to watch more lectures in order to explain this in detail, I will come back to this
