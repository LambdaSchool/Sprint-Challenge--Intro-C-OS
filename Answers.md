# Sprint Challenge: Intro-to-C

## Name at least three things that an operating system is responsible for handling?


The operating system acts as an interface between the hardware and the programs requesting I/O and it's main responsibilities of the OS are:

1. Hiding the complexities of hardware from the user.

2. Managing between the hardware's resources which include the processors, memory, data storage and I/O devices.

3. Handling "interrupts" generated by the I/O controllers.

4. Sharing of I/O between many programs using the CPU.
