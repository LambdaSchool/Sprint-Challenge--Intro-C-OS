## Challenge 1

Name at least three things that an operating system is responsible for handling?

An operating system, or "OS," is software that communicates with the hardware and allows other programs to run.  An operating system has several main functions:

1. Manage the computer's resources, such as the central processing unit, memory management, disk drives, and printers.

2. Memory / Scheduling Management of applications:  In a multitasking operating system where multiple programs can be running at the same time, the operating system determines which applications should run in what order and how much time should be allowed for each application before giving another application a turn.  It manages the sharing of internal memory among multiple applications.  It handles input and output to and from attached hardware devices, such as hard disks, printers, and dial-up ports.  It sends messages to each application or interactive user (or to a system operator) about the status of operation and any errors that may have occurred.  It can offload the management of what are called batch jobs (for example, printing) so that the initiating application is freed from this work.  On computers that can provide parallel processing, an operating system can manage how to divide the program so that it runs on more than one processor at a time.

3. Establish a Graphical user interface.  It significantly affects how you interact with the device such as file/folder management.

4. Hardware Adaptibility:  Allows you to install and run third party programs written for the operating system. (ie: Windows and Linux can be installed on standard PC hardware, while OS X is designed to run on Apple systems).
