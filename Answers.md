# Describe in as much detail as you can _how_ these tasks are handled by the operating system. 
User Interface -> Keyed commands are accepted and executed by the OS or if there is a GUI then commands can be accepted by the user pointing and clicking at objects on the screen

Memory Management -> the computer keeps track of everything in memory. It will utilize blank spots in memory as appropriate and update it's records to reflect what has been used.

Runs Applications -> other programs called applications must be written to run on top of the OS; the OS runs the application by locating and loading it appropriately; most OS can run many applications at once

Controls Computer Hardware -> all programs needing access to computer hardware go thru the OS via BIOS or drivers

Manages External Resources -> Anything that can be connected to the computer ; the computer will check to see if it has the correct drivers to run the resource: if it does the item will function as expected, if not the computer will return an error.

Security -> Software updates, firewalls, account management
