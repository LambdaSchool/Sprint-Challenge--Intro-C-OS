## Challenge 1

Name at least three things that an operating system is responsible for handling?

1.  An OS is responsible for “running” many programs via the CPU (multitasking),
    by scheduling tasks, creating processes, and network.
1.  An OS is also responsible for allowing humans to utilize hardware better
    (CPU, RAM, persisent storage, keyboard, etc.) via user-friendly interfaces,
    such as a CLI and GUI.
1.  The OS has helped humans utilize the power of binary to do amazing things,
    like explore the furthest reaches of the universe,
    make complex calculations for states that might not even exist,
    and most importantly,
    create memes for our favorite furry companions.
