## Challenge 1

### Name at least three things that an operating system is responsible for handling? 

1. The Operating System behaves as an interface between the computer's hardware and the user. The OS is responsible for managing the execution of various software programs on the machine.

2. The OS is, itself, software, which performs tasks including memory management. The OS keeps track of what parts of memory are in use and which program is using which parts of memory. When memory is allocated to a process, the OS performs the allocation. Once that memory is no longer needed, the OS de-allocates the memory by removing the pointer to it.

3. Other tasks the OS has is to manage the processor. this is called process scheduling, and acts as a sort of air traffic controller allowing plane landings and takeoffs on a single runway. Each process must have its turn, and the OS decides how much time and in which order to give a process access to the CPU for necessary calculations.

Another task the OS performs is managing communication between the machine and the peripheral devices, to control data to and from the input and output devices.
