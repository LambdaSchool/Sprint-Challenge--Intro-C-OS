## Three things that an operating system is reponsible for handling
 - Provides the fundamental concept of a process. Processes are applications that run in user space. The operating system allocates a list of processes called the process table
 - Responsible for providing user programs access to memory. The operating system creates a stack from at the beginning of a program's execution and allocates a section of available free memory for it to utilize
 - Keeps a record of all files in the system, called the File Table
