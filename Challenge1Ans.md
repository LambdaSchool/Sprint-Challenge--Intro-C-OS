## Challenge 1

Name at least three things that an operating system is responsible for handling?

1. ```User Interface: ```The most important operation of an OS is to abstract the hardware to the programmer or user. Without this fundamental operation, every programmer would have to know everything down to the most basic operations of each hardware component. This would not allow for easy compatibility as one would basically have to rewrite the software for each new piece of hardware.

2. ```Memory Management: ```When a piece of software is initialized, the OS finds and copies the software from the HD into the RAM. After that, the CPU will be able to access it. The caveat is that there must be enough available space on RAM in order for the copy from the HD to happen. This is necessary because otherwise, another piece of software could potentially be overwritten. Lastly, memory management can also help prevent from the computer crashing.

3. ```Multitasking: ```The OS is responsible for for resources management within the system. Tasks are constantly competing for resources such as processor times, memory, disk space and user input. The OS mediates these processes and allows them to function in an orderly fashion. Again, if the OS cannot handle this, a user's computer could crash and/or explode.
