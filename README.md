# Sprint-Challenge: Intro to C and Operating Systems

Complete both challenges, below.

_The Challenge 2 code needs a Unix-like environment to work! That includes
Linux, macos, MinGW, Cygwin, WSL, BSD, etc._

If you want to test if your environment is set up for it, compile and
run the [testdir.c](examples/testdir.c) program in the `examples/`
directory. It should print `Testing: PASS`.

## Challenge 1

1. ### What are some of the tasks that a general operating system is responsible for handling?

* The opertaing system is a multi-user system that could run multiple programs (_multitasking_) on a machine. It is considered the brains of the computer that allows the user to interact with the machine itself without having to communicate in machine code.
* At the base level of the OS is the process scheduler that swaps between programs at an insanely fast rate to give time for the program to be ran for the user. So in short it executes programs and schedules them to ensure each program is getting what it needs to maintain its run. This is the _Kernel_ (Known as the Alpha Program of the computer)
* Manages memory that the entire system uses.
* Provides access to execute hardware with the means of specific software called drivers.
* Creates a file system for addressing long term storage
* Handles the "interrupts" generated by the I/O controllers.

2. ### Describe in as much detail as you can _how_ these tasks are handled by the operating system.

  - The operating system coordinates the space allocations in RAM to ensure that there is enough space for the waiting instructions and data. When there isnâ€™t sufficient space in RAM for all the data and instructions, then the OS allocates the least necessary files to temporary storage on the hard drive, called virtual memory.
  The OS manages storage by providing a file management system that keeps track of the names and locations of files and programs. The device drivers are special progrrams that facilitate communication between hardware devices that are attached to the computer and the OS. Device drivers translate the specific commands of devices to commands that the OS can understand.

  - In order for the operating system to manage its multitasking, it usually has some code that is called an _interrupt handler_. The interrupt handler prioritizes the interrupts and saves them in a _queue_ if more than one is waiting to be handled. The operating system has another little program, sometimes called a scheduler, that figures out which program to give control to next.

## Challenge 2

Write a program in C, `lsls.c`, that prints out a directory listing for the
directory the user specifies on the command line. If the user does not specify a
directory, print out the contents of the current directory, which is called `.`.

Example runs:

```
$ ./lsls
.
..
lsls.c
lsls

$ ./lsls /home/exampleuser
.
..
.config
.vim
.yarnrc
.bashrc
foo.c
.vscode
Downloads
.gitconfig
.bash_history
.viminfo
src
```

To parse the command line, you'll have to look at `argc` and `argv` specified in
your `int main(int argc, char **argv)`. Example code to print all command line
arguments can be found in [commandline.c](examples/commandline.c).

General approach: Call `opendir()`, then repeatedly call `readdir()`--printing
the filenames as you go--until it says there are no more entries, then call
`closedir()`

You will be using functionality included in `<dirent.h>`. This header file holds
the declarations for `DIR`, `struct dirent`, `opendir()`, `readdir()`, and
`closedir()`, below.

* `DIR *opendir(char *path)`: This function opens the directory named in `path`
  and returns a pointer to a variable of type `DIR` that will be used later. If
  there is an error, `opendir()` returns `NULL`.

* `struct dirent *readdir(DIR *d)`: Reads the next directory entry from the
  `DIR` returned by `opendir()`. Returns the result as a pointer to a `struct dirent` (see below). Returns `NULL` if there are no more directory entires.

* `closedir(DIR *d)`: Close a directory (opened previously with `opendir()`)
  when you're done with it.

The `struct dirent *` returned by `readdir()` has the following fields in it:

```c
struct dirent {
  ino_t  d_ino       // file serial number
  char   d_name[]    // file name, a string
};
```

For output, you should print the field `d_name`.

### Stretch Goal: Print file size in bytes

Modify the program to print out the file size in bytes as well as the name.

Example output (suggestion: use `%10lld` to print the size in a
field of width 10):

```
$ ./lsls
    224  .
    992  ..
   1722  lsls.c
   8952  lsls
```

You'll need to use the `stat()` call in `<sys/stat.h>`.

* `int stat(char *fullpath, struct stat *buf)`: For a given full path to a file
  (i.e. the path passed to `opendir()` following by a `/` followed by the name
  of the file in `d_name`), fill the fields of a `struct stat` that you've
  pointed to. Returns `-1` on error.

  ```c
  // Example stat() usage

  struct stat buf;

  stat("./lsls.c", &buf);

  printf("file size is %lld\n", buf.st_size);
  ```

### Stretch Goal: Mark Directories

Instead of a size in bytes for a directory, replace the number with
the string `<DIR>`.

Example output:

```
$ ./lsls
     <DIR>  .
     <DIR>  ..
      1717  lsls.c
      8952  lsls
```

The `st_mode` field in the `struct stat` buffer holds information
about the file permissions and type of file.

If you bitwise-AND the value with `S_IFDIR` and get a non-zero
result, the file is a directory.

(If you bitwise-AND the value with `S_IFREG` and get a non-zero
result, the file is a regular file, as opposed to a device node,
symbolic link, hard link, directory, named pipe, etc.)
