Name at least three things that an operating system is responsible for handling?

-  The OS hides the complexities of hardware from the user by providing a user interface.
-  The OS has a scheduler which is responsible for determining what processes get priority for CPU time.
-  The OS is responsible for managing the hardwareâ€™s resources (processors, memory, data storage).
