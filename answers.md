What are some of the tasks that a general operating system is responsible for handling?

The operating system is the interface between Human and Machine. How much help is provided to the user, is dependent on which operating system you use. There are also differences in how the user interacts with the machine based on the operating system of choice.

One of the main tasks of the OS is to handle system resources. Everything from processors, data storage, memory, interrupts, communication between software and hardware, and peripherals.

Th OS will help determine which interrupts get priority over others, allocate memory usage to programs depending on their needs and prioroty, and help the user to bend the computer to their will.



Describe in as much detail as you can _how_ these tasks are handled by the operating system. 

The user interacts with the computer through a UI, asking the computer to perform a task. Instructions are found in the code, RAM space is allocated, necessary code is pushed into memory, program counter is set to the memory location specified in code, execution begins.

While multi-tasking (concurrency) is possible, the extent of it is determined by the hardware. Multiple cores and ram allow the computer to handle multiple tasks at a time, however system resources and low level instructions will dictate which operations gain priority over others in the queue for CPU time (interrupts).
