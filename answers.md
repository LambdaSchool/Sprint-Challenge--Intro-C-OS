### Name at least three things that an operating system is responsible for handling?

1.  It is the intermediary between the normal software and the hardware.  Normal programs don't inherently have the necessary permissions to access memory and they go through the OS to read/write from/to RAM.
1.  It uses drivers to ensure the hardware and peripherals are working correctly.  Each type of hardware/peripheral has a general guideline for how the information is delivered; this ensures that the OS can handle the data being delivered in the appropriate way.
1.  It uses a file system to keep track of where files are stored on the hard disk.
