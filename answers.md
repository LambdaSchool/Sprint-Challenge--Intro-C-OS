# Name at least three things that an operating system is responsible for handling?

The OS is an interface between the hardware and the programs requesting I/O. It:

1) Hides the complexities of hardware from the user through the use of a user interface, which is typically either a command line interface (CLI) or a graphical user interface (GUI)

2) Manages the hardware (processors, memory, data storage, I/O devices)

3) Handles interrupts from the I/O controllers

4) Shares I/O between the programs using the CPU
