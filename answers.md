Name at least three things that an operating system is responsible for handling?

1. The operating system is repsonsible for keeping non-privledged processes from using too many resources.

2. The os manages process scheduling, which determines what process should run and when to process that process if necessary. 

3. The os can talk to other devices that connect to it, such as external storage devices that have drivers to facilitate the communication process.
