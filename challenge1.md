##Introduction:

#(Context)
In today's digital world, people use computers everyday, but one of the pieces that allows these fabulous inventions to function so effectively is often taken for granted. The use of computers often happens via the medium of users engaging with applications that provide value to the user. But, the system that is often overlooked in this interaction is the Operating System of a computer system. The OS often plays a seamless and quiet background role that actually is the foundation for the applications that all users enjoy having today. Increasing the level of understanding of the Operating System magic that happens under the hood is helpful for appreciating the entirety of the technology powers society everyday.

##Body:

#(Point1: Intro the problem)
Without an operating system a computer would be simply a "dead piece of hardware", essentially a set of carefully crafted, but lifeless pieces of metal. In order to bring the metal to life, an OS is required to provide the instructions for letting it  do the sorts of tasks that we would like it to.

#(Point2: What pieces of a computer does the OS bring alive?)
Almost every computer is composed of a CPU, Memory (RAM and Hard drive), and peripheral devices and controllers (the components that connect each of the pieces together via wires and allow the user to interact with the computer). This is the hardware that requires an OS to provide a set of rules that orchestrate each component to function cohesively and guide it to do certain things and take certain actions when receiving specific electrical signals. This allows for code to be written for the hardware and provide a stable experience and apply the hardware to achieve some end. These pieces of code are often called applications.

#(Point3: How the OS translates the language of electronics.)
Applications, which people use on the computer needs translator to take the code and get the hardware to perform some actions. The OS provides that translations service at the electrical signal level. This portion of the OS is called the kernel. The kernel has a number of functions some of which include: process management for the CPU, memory management for the Ram, File Table management for the Hard drive, and device management for other peripherals that are connected to the computer. All of these take the electrical signals from code written for the computer and interprets it into electrical instructions that these components can "understand". Developers do this by writing code in a higher level language such as C and that is translated (compiled) into the byte code, the language that the OS will take to the other components. All of the functions, computing, saving files, accessing the internet is all enabled by the operating system that acts as the bridge between application software and the hardware. Together these technologies work in tandem to provide users the rich experience that is possible today.

##Conclusion:
When people turn on a computer, sometimes all the magic that happens passes them by. A computer is a finely tuned machine, from the hardware all the way to the Operating systems that run on them (MacOS, Linux, and Windows). Numerous have designed these systems to work together to be the amazing innovation that it is. Sometimes, bugs cause the devices to crash and for computers to not function. But, when they have the right hardware and software, people can begin to tap into the computational power of the computer and do things that people dream of.
