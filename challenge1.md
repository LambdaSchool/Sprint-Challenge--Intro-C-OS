If no opporating system was in place, writing software would be much more diffucult.
The software would have to control writing files and keeping track of their addresses.
The software would also have to communicate with drivers specifically to do things like control the screen, access the hard drive, access graphics cards,
manage RAM, and do all of those in a way that's specialized for each individual part.
You would have to write all of this in assembly language which I know almost nothing about.
Sounds pretty bad.
Massive steps would have to be taken to perform the simplist of tasks.
