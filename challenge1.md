Answer here

When it comes to boot order, CPU gets power and loads BIOS (collection of programs contained in the Read Only Memory (ROM) chip). ROM allows the CPU to communicate with various devices attached to the motherboard The first BIOS process that occurs is Power On Self Test (POST). POST allows us to read and write a memory, send commands to CPU. 

So I guess that would probably enough to manage system and write a program if we know C lanaguage. Why C language? Most of operating systems were written in C or C++. 

But I'am not sure if could open open Comand promt(cmd) or terminal in BIOS mode. :)
