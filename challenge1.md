When the computer powers on , it runs a POST (Power On Self Test) to make sure all hardware if fuctioning properly.

### BIOS 
The first process to every computer after the POST step, is booting into the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System);

### BOOTLOADER 
At this point the BIOS will load the code from the sector 0 of the HDD.

### SOURCE CODE
In order for the BIOS to execute the source code it would need to be in Assembly code or Machine Code (Binary) to manipluate the hardware directly. Another route to take would be to create a Custom Kernel to handle the steps through your program and memory management.
