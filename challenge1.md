#Run a Program without an Operating System

## Commands that utilize computer's logic gates  
We would require some instructions for the computer that utilize the logic gates inside the CPU to produce the  
desired results. In order to compute efficiently, we would need to store memory in the RAM, so we would have to have  
some way of storing to the ram some registers that hold values that are going to be used in computing or the  
result of these computations. 

Then, utilizing commands, and storing values to registers, we can access registers  
and compute values. If we require the computer to do anything else such as displaying data, it would entail  
giving instructions to the computer specific to the hardware so that it could display a value to the screen.  


If we wanted to save data to the hard disk, we would have to give the computer commands according to the hardware   
of the hard disk, commands that include storing binary representations of data in the sections of the hard disk  
and a method of retrieving, overwriting, or deleting the data.
