  Operating systems provide numerous services that ease the process of writing software. An operating system
essentially acts as an interface between a software program and a computer's hardware. This allows the operating
system to abstract away the complexities of interacting with hardware from a software program. For example,
NVIDIA and AMD provide device drivers for their graphics cards. These drivers are specific to an operating system 
and allow the operating system to interact with the graphics cards. Without the operating system, a software program
would need to interact directly with these device drivers. Given the numerous types of devices and an even greater number
of device drivers, it would quickly become untenable for a software program to have to directly support device drivers.
  Another important service that operating systems provide is multitasking. This service is integral to modern computers and
allows multiple programs to execute on the same hardware. For example, a user can easily switch between a web browser
and a word processor. The are numerous complexities to supporting multitasking. For example, the operating system manages
process scheduling, which determines how much time a process has access to the CPU. By passing control of the CPU between
different software programs, the operating system allows numerous programs to run on a computer's hardware. This allows a 
software program to be written as if it has unlimited access to a computer's hardware. It is the operating system's job to 
share resources between programs.
  Another important service provided by operating systems is memory management. A software program needs to be loaded into 
memory before it can be executed. It is crucial that a software program's section of memory is isolated from other programs'
memory for security and stability reasons. If a software program could read and manipulate another program's section of memory,
it could potentially have access to sensitive information and be able to influence the other program's behavior. Because the
operating system manages memory, on a multitasking platform, a software program does not need to worry about the security implications of other software program's being able to access its memory. 
  There are numerous other services that operating systems provide. From accessing a hard drive to sending data over a network,
the operating system abstracts away the complexities of interacting with the huge range of hardware available today. With out an operating system, writing even simple software programs would be vastly more difficult.
