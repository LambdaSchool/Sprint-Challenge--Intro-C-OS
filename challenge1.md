# How to write software without an OS

## What is an OS?

An OS is short for Operating System. An operating system is responsible for communicating with the machine parts of your computer in order to produce a GUI, or Graphical User Interface. 

The GUI and OS are required if you want to manipulate the machine for personal use. Granted you can just use a terminal in order to accomplish your needs, but in the age of touch screen phones and speech recognition that is considered blasphemy for the mass majority.

Writing software without any type of OS in place is impossible. As the software has no platform to base it's syntax off of. We would need to have some sort of ground level code in place in order to climb up to the higher level languages. Coincidentally, the high level language in the case of running no OS would in fact be C.

## Is this even possible?

You may be asking this question, and the answer would be yes, yes it is. But prepare your minds for a level of tedium you have never experienced before. We are entering the realm of the sacred and ancient assembly language!


## What is this Assembly Language thing and why is it 'sacred'?

Okay, it's not _actually_ sacred. It was a joke- loosen up! In terms of it being _ancient_ - that's actually not too far off. Assembly language is the foundation for all Operating systems, and high level programming languages. 

Remember that ridiculous statment I made earlier about the C programming language _'being high level'_? Well to an Assembly Language it _is_ high level. 

C code is notorious for brushing against the bare metal of the machine. That's programmer speak for being a low level language in which you have control (for better or for worse) over most, if not all, of your system's resources.

If C code brushes the metal then Assembly code shapes it.

## So how do we actually write software without an OS? 

This will require a little bit of hacking and metal shaping. 

In order to accomplish this task we should first write a basic Assembly program that would load all of the necessary components for use. These components would be used by the programming language that we want to write the software in. 

After that is finished we should then load that Assembly code onto a bootable external disk. Flash drive would be perfect for this. 

When booting the computer with no OS it will scream at you for not having said OS. In order to remedy this we go into the BIOS to change the boot settings. 

This is different between most machines, but it's not hard to find. 

We scoot the flash drive that we want to boot from to the top of the list then reboot the machine.

If everything boots up and the computer doesn't scream at you- then you have a mini OS that you can program from. Have fun! 

* Please note that I did not go into too much detail about assembly because, well, I'm not good at Assembly. There are heaps of online resources for this.
