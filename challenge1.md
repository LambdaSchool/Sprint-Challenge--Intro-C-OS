Writing software with no operating system would be a challenge, though it is a challenge that embedded systems programmers know all too well. Programming without an OS necessitates interfacing directly with the hardware. The CPU only knows how to execute it's instruction set, anything beyond that would have to be handled manually. None of the luxuries provided by the OS are there, memory management, do it yourself, telling the components how to talk to each other, again have to do it manually. You would need to write your own file system if you needed any hard drive support, as well the drivers necessary to run the thing. A process scheduler would need to be made if you wanted to be able to run more than one program at a time. Networking? Fahgettaboudit, or write it yourself. Want a UI? Good luck.
