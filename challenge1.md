## challenge 1:

Which means you would have to create your own bare bones mini OS?
If thats the case then:

a boat loader, to load your mini OS.
You would need to write logic with a low level lang (C or ASM) for:
	Memory Managment,
	File directoy system,
	and Drivers for periphals

	As well a kernel that handles:
		threads, processes, and scheduler to handle the threads and processes

I should go deeper into and describe the inner workings and mechanicms of those concepets.
As that would add to the answer of the question.

To get to the question of "what would you need to do to write software with no OS",
is it possible to right software with no OS?  Maybe basic a calculator or funcationalities
that hinge on basic arthmatic, like a clock or a score board?  But if you were to do anything remotely
complex, the amount of unreadable code would grow exponentially.

So it seems you need an OS to handle the lowest level of abstractions in memory and arithmatic.
