### What do operating systems do?

When thinking about operating systems, we usually have a few things instantly come to mind: Apple, Windows, Linux, possibly Android.  

We often take for granted the fact that computers are able to perform so many different actions.  

The reason this is possible all comes back to the operating system. At a basic level, an operating system is a program that controls and manages the hardware and software on a computer.

If a cpu is the brain of a computer, then the operating system is the nervous system, carrying messages throughout the system to ensure that everything functions the way it is supposed to.

Here are just a few things that operating systems are responsible for:

* Application management
* Routing user input and system output
* Use of device drivers in order to interact with peripherals attached peripherals
* Memory management
* Message relay to the CPU for processing

If it were not for modern operating systems, many devices, including phones, tablets, computers, and even smart watches would never have developed into the kinds of devices we have today. 

Something to think about:  How do you think operating systems will change over the next 10 years?  Can you think of anything that is likely to be very different a few years from now?
